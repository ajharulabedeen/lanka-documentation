\section{User Loggin}
Upon the entry of your username and password, an automatic redirection to the dashboard for which you have permission will be initiated.

\section{Super Admin}
In the Super Admin Dashboard, the super admin has the capability to view various user dashboards. There are four types of dashboards available: RO, RM, CM, and HOD. To access a specific user's dashboard, follow these steps:

\subsection{Select User Role}
Choose the desired user role (RO, RM, CM, or HOD) from the available options.

\subsection{Enter Specific User Name}
Input the username of the specific user whose dashboard you wish to access.

\subsection{Press the "Details" Button}
Click the "Details" button to initiate the process.

\subsection{Verification Process}
The system will perform a verification check to determine if the specified user and role combination exists in the people allocation logic.

\subsection{Outcome Handling}
If the user and role match the people allocation, you will be automatically redirected to the corresponding dashboard. In the event of a mismatch or if the user is not found, a message will be displayed indicating that the user was not found.
